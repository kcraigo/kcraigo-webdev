According to this California State Law, under the Business and Professions Code, Division 8 Special Business Regulations, Chapter 22 Internet Privacy Requirements, operators of commercial websites that collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from California’s residents are required to conspicuously post and comply with a privacy policy that meets specific requirements. A website operator who fails to post their privacy policy within 30 days after being notified about noncompliance, will be deemed in violation. PII includes such information as name, street address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, Social Security number, or other details about a person that could allow a consumer to be contacted physically or online.

The act, effective April 21, 2000, applies to the online collection of personal information by persons or entities under U.S. jurisdiction about children under 13 years of age. It details what a website operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent or guardian, and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children’s privacy and safety online including restrictions on the marketing of those under 13.

The FTC has been studying online privacy issues since 1995, and in its 1998 report,the Commission described the widely accepted Fair Information Practice Principles of **Notice, Choice, Access, and Security**. The Commission also identified **Enforcement **, the use of a reliable mechanism to provide sanctions for noncompliance as a critical component of any governmental or self-regulatory program to protect online privacy.
