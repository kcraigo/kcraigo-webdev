In this last post of the series let's look at Dataflows. Everytime you import data with Power Query a Dataflow is created. You can rename your dataflow and then setup a timer job in CloudFlows to call your Dataflow and keep your Dataverse Table updated with the latest and greatest changes.

See my video below for a walk through on importing data into your Dataverse For Teams database with Dataflows.
