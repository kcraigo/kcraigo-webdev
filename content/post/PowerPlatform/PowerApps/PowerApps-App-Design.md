# Power Apps Design - Step 1!

Gather User Requirements, draft use cases, create mind maps with programs like Mindnode or Mindmanager, create Entity Diagrams in something like draw.io, or even paper and pencil. Determine what is the purpose of the app. Draft process flows to show the flow of information from start to finish. 

Ask yourself and others all types of questions such as,

What type of reporting should the application support?

What integrations should be planned for? Power Automate, Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, blog posts, chatbots, Microsoft Teams, email systems etc.

What form factors need to be supported? Mobile, Tablet / Web etc.

What is the datasource going to be? SharePoint or a premium licensed database such as Azure SQL, Dataverse, CosmosDB, AWS Aurora etc.

Is the app for personal use, department use, or is it open to all employees in the enterprise?

Are there Legal concerns that need to be addressed? i.e., Copyrights, Licensing, Contracts, SOW's, NDA's, SIA's (Security Information Assessments), PII Attestations, SOC 2 Type 2, Bridge Letters, NIST 800 certification, ISO27001 certification, California Privacy Law, GDPR, Architecture reviews, Encryption At Rest and In-Transit, Data protection with RBAC (Role Based Access Control), SSO (Single Sign On).
