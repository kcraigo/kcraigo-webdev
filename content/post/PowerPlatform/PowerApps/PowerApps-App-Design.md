2. SharePoint

# Power Apps Design - Step 1!

Gather User Requirements, draft use cases, create mind maps with programs like Mindnode or Mindmanager, create Entity Diagrams in something like draw.io, or even paper and pencil. Determine what is the purpose of the app. Draft process flows to show the flow of information from start to finish. 

Ask yourself and others all types of questions such as,

What type of reporting should the application support?

What integrations should be planned for? Power Automate, Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, blog posts, chatbots, Microsoft Teams, email systems etc.

What form factors need to be supported? Mobile, Tablet / Web etc.

What is the datasource going to be? SharePoint or a premium licensed database such as Azure SQL, Dataverse, CosmosDB, AWS Aurora etc.

Is the app for personal use, department use, or is it open to all employees in the enterprise?

Are there Legal concerns that need to be addressed? i.e., Copyrights, Licensing, Contracts, SOW's, NDA's, SIA's (Security Information Assessments), PII Attestations, SOC 2 Type 2, Bridge Letters, NIST 800 certification, ISO27001 certification, California Privacy Law, GDPR, Architecture reviews, Encryption At Rest and In-Transit, Data protection with RBAC (Role Based Access Control), SSO (Single Sign On). 

Everyone says to use ChatGPT so here it goes!

## Prompt:
Write a design process in creating an Enterprise application for business travelers to request parking space for their vehicle for when they go on business travel

## ChatGPT Response
Designing an enterprise application for business travelers to request parking space involves several key steps in the design process. Here's a comprehensive outline:

1. ### Define Objectives and Scope:
- Clearly define the purpose and objectives of the application.
- Identify the target audience (business travelers) and understand their needs and pain points.
- Determine the scope of the application, including features and functionalities.

2. ### Market Research:
- Conduct market research to identify existing solutions and potential competitors.
- Analyze user reviews and feedback on similar applications to understand user expectations and common issues.

3. ###  User Personas:
- Create detailed user personas representing different types of business travelers.
- Consider factors such as job roles, travel frequency, technological proficiency, and preferences.

4. ###  Requirements Gathering:
- Work closely with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
- Identify key features, such as parking location selection, reservation management, payment processing, and integration with travel itineraries.

5. ### Wireframing and Prototyping:
- Develop wireframes and prototypes to visualize the user interface and flow.
- Collect feedback from stakeholders and potential users to refine the design.

6. ### Information Architecture:
- Define the information architecture, including the organization of parking locations, user profiles, reservation history, and any other relevant data.

7. ### User Flow Design:
- Design intuitive user flows for various scenarios, from initial login to submitting a parking request.
- Ensure a seamless experience with minimal friction.

8. ###  UI/UX Design:
- Create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- Ensure a consistent design language and user experience across all screens.
- Consider accessibility principles to accommodate users with diverse needs.

9. ### Backend System Design:
- Define the backend architecture, including databases, servers, and APIs.
- Ensure scalability, security, and reliability of the system.

10. ### Integration with External Systems:
- Integrate the application with travel management systems, calendars, and payment gateways.
- Ensure data consistency and real-time updates.

11. ### Security Measures:
- Implement robust security measures to protect user data and transactions.
- Use encryption, secure authentication, and regular security audits.

13. ### Testing:
- Conduct thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
- Identify and address any bugs or usability issues.

14. ###  Deployment:
- Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing.
- Once validated, deploy the application to production.

15. ###  Monitoring and Maintenance:
- Implement monitoring tools to track application performance.
- Set up a maintenance plan for regular updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.

16. ###  User Training and Support:
- Develop user documentation and provide training resources.
- Establish a support system to assist users with any issues or questions.

17. ###  Feedback and Iteration:
- Encourage user feedback and monitor application analytics.
- Iterate on the design based on user input and evolving business needs.
